/*
  The SmartFund contract is what holds all the tokens and ether, and contains all the logic
  for calculating its value (and ergo profit), allows users to deposit/withdraw their funds,
  and calculates the fund managers cut of the funds profit among other things.
  The SmartFund gets the value of its token holdings (in Ether) and trades through the ExchangePortal
  contract. This means that as new exchange capabalities are added to new exchange portals, the
  SmartFund will be able to upgrade to a new exchange portal, and trade a wider variety of assets
  with a wider variety of exchanges. The SmartFund is also connected to a PermittedExchanges contract,
  which determines which exchange portals the SmartFund is allowed to connect to, restricting
  the fund owners ability to connect to a potentially malicious contract. In order for a new
  exchange portal to be added to PermittedExchanges, a 3 day timeout must pass, in which time
  the public may audit the new contract code to be assured that the new exchange portal does
  not allow the manager to act maliciously with the funds holdings.
